# 🧠 My Mentorship Materials

Welcome to the repository where I share the materials I prepare for my mentorship sessions. I believe that knowledge should be accessible to everyone, so I'm making these resources available to the community. Whether you're a beginner in machine learning or looking to deepen your understanding, I hope you'll find these materials useful!

## 🏫 About This Repository

My goal is to introduce my mentee to various areas of machine learning and the tools commonly used in the field. While these materials are tailored for our sessions, they are designed to be beneficial for anyone interested in machine learning and tools used for it.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

In this repository, you’ll find:
- **Presentations:** Slides and notes from our lessons covering various topics in machine learning.
- **Code Examples:** Hands-on examples and code snippets that illustrate key concepts.
- **Additional Resources:** Links to articles, papers, and other resources that complement the materials.
- **Assignments:** Exercises and projects to practice what you’ve learned.

Directory Structure:
- In "Lesson_{i}" folders, you'll find ready-to-use lesson materials for each session.
- The ["src"](./src/) folder contains supplementary materials (e.g., .key files of presentations).
