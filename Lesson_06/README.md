# Lesson 6: Numpy

In this lesson, we focus on the Numpy library, which serves as a robust and adaptable open-source resource for scientific computing with Python. NumPy provides support for large, multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.
